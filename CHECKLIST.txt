Rails
[ ] Follow Rails MVC and RESTful conventions. That means, for example, that a request GET /puppies ought to be handled by the PuppiesController, fetch puppies from the database using a Puppy Active Record model, and return a list of puppies as JSON.
[ ] Well-named variables and methods
[ ] Short, single-purpose methods
Git
[ ] Aim for a large number of small commits - commit frequently!
[ ] Add meaningful messages to your commits. When you look back at your commits with git log, the messages should describe each change.
[ ] Don't include changes in a commit that aren't related to the commit message
